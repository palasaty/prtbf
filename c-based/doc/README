Project uses 3rd party libs
- protobuf-c: for generating packed messages for current .proto file
- protobuf2json-c: for generating json from packed message
- janson: dependency for previous one

They downloaded via cmake ExternalProject_Add
URL - zip from github
PREFIX - where to locate

protobuf2json-c need to be patched
see proto2json.patch file

also protobuf2json-c uses autotools toolchain
so, more verbose params for configure, make and install

for good installing you should be root

after protobuf-c is ready, cmake generate protobuf bindings for .proto file
and linked with libprotobuf-c and libprotobuf2json

in demo program:
- Object init
- Set fields
- Convert to json using inner protobuf field
- print to stdout
